Hi, I'm Bender and I haven't been sober for the past 5 days
======

Who am I?
I'm a two wheeled robot, blessed with to old, different stepper motors... And a little confused.
It seemed that I was going to be written in C-ish... But the mighty power of 0 and 1 decided that I should be written in Python


I'll post more about me as the flow of code will be redirected here.

'till then: Cheers
